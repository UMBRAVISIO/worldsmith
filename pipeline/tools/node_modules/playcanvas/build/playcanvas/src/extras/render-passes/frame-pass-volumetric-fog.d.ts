/**
 * Frame pass implementation of volumetric fog lit by a directional light. A reduced resolution
 * raymarch pass accumulates in-scattered light and transmittance along each view ray, sampling
 * the light's cascaded shadow map to form visible light shafts, and a combine pass blends the
 * result over the scene render target using a depth-aware upsample.
 *
 * Algorithm details:
 *
 * The raymarch pass renders a full-screen quad into an RGBA16F texture sized as a fraction
 * (scale) of the scene render target, storing the in-scattered light in rgb and the
 * transmittance in alpha. For each pixel, a world space view ray is reconstructed from the
 * camera's inverse view matrix and projection scale, and marched from the camera to the scene
 * surface - the distance is derived from the linear depth prepass texture and clamped to
 * maxDistance. The march uses a fixed number of steps, with the sample positions offset along
 * the ray by per-pixel interleaved gradient noise to hide banding. When TAA is enabled, the
 * noise pattern additionally cycles each frame using a golden-ratio sequence, and TAA
 * accumulates the dithered results into a smooth solution over time.
 *
 * The fog media is modeled as exponential height fog: the density is constant below heightBase
 * and decays exponentially above it, controlled by heightFalloff. At each step, the light
 * visibility is evaluated with a single tap of the directional light's cascaded shadow map -
 * the cascade is selected from the sample's view depth, and the tap uses hardware depth
 * comparison for depth-format shadow maps (PCF) or a manual comparison for color-format maps
 * storing depth (PCSS / VSM). The in-scattered radiance combines the light color scaled by the
 * Henyey-Greenstein phase function (evaluated once per ray, as the light direction is constant)
 * with an ambient term that keeps fog in shadowed areas visible. The scattering is accumulated
 * front-to-back weighted by the current transmittance, and the transmittance is attenuated per
 * step using Beer-Lambert extinction, with an early out once it becomes negligible.
 *
 * Optionally the clustered omni and spot lights scatter light in the fog as well, which is added
 * into the fog texture by a second raymarch pass. As the radiance of a local light varies rapidly
 * along the ray, a march shared by all the lights would need an impractical number of steps, and
 * so each light is instead rendered as a separate quad covering the screen space bounds of its
 * volume, with the ray marched only over the part of it which is inside the volume - the segment
 * is evaluated analytically by intersecting the ray with the bounding sphere of the light, further
 * clipped to the cone slab of a spot light. The light properties come from the light directly, and
 * the visibility and the cookie of the light are sampled from the clustered lighting atlases with
 * a single tap per step. The transmittance between the camera and each sample is evaluated
 * analytically from the closed form of the height fog optical depth, as the samples of this pass
 * are not contiguous, and only the in-scattered light is blended in, leaving the transmittance
 * stored in the alpha channel to the directional pass.
 *
 * The combine pass runs at full resolution and blends the fog texture over the scene render
 * target as scene * transmittance + inscatter, using alpha blending so no extra copy of the
 * scene is needed. To upsample the low resolution fog without leaking across geometry edges,
 * it takes the 4 nearest fog texels and weights them by their bilinear factors multiplied by
 * the depth similarity between the full resolution pixel and each low resolution sample. The
 * pass executes before TAA and bloom in the frame, so the fog participates in temporal
 * anti-aliasing and bright shafts contribute to the bloom.
