/**
 * The JointComponent constrains the relative motion of two rigid bodies. The entity holding the
 * joint component is not itself constrained - instead, its world transform defines the joint
 * frame: the anchor point and axes that the constraint operates about. The constrained bodies are
 * assigned via {@link entityA} and {@link entityB}, both of which must have a
 * {@link RigidBodyComponent}. If {@link entityB} is null, {@link entityA} is constrained to a
 * fixed point in world space.
 *
 * A joint's primary axis is the joint entity's local X axis: a hinge rotates about X, a slider
 * translates along X and a ball joint twists about X. To aim a joint, rotate the joint entity. A
 * common pattern is to parent the joint entity to {@link entityA} at the pivot point.
 *
 * The joint frames are captured when the underlying constraint is created - typically when the
 * component is enabled and both bodies are present in the physics simulation. Moving the joint
 * entity afterwards has no effect on an existing constraint. Call {@link refreshFrames} to
 * re-capture the frames from the current world transforms. Entity scale is ignored, matching the
 * behavior of rigid bodies.
 *
 * At creation the two joint frames coincide, so every degree of freedom reads zero: limits and
 * equilibrium values are measured from the initial relative pose of the two bodies, not from the
 * joint entity's transform or any absolute separation. Linear degrees of freedom are positive
 * when {@link entityB} (or the world anchor when {@link entityB} is null) moves along the
 * joint's positive axes relative to {@link entityA}. Angular degrees of freedom measure the
 * opposite body: they are positive when {@link entityA} rotates counter-clockwise about the
 * joint's axes relative to {@link entityB} or the world anchor, viewed from each axis's positive
 * end (right-handed). In the door hinge example below, the limits of `[0, 110]` let the door
 * swing counter-clockwise, viewed from above, up to 110 degrees from its starting pose.
 *
 * Many properties apply only to specific joint types; each one documents the types it affects,
 * and properties without such a note (for example {@link entityA}, {@link enableCollision} and
 * {@link breakImpulse}) apply to all types.
 *
 * To add a JointComponent to an {@link Entity}, use {@link Entity#addComponent}:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * // Create a door hinge: the joint entity's position is the hinge point and its
 * // local X axis (rotated here to point up) is the hinge axis
 * const hinge = new Entity('hinge');
 * hinge.setPosition(1, 1, 0);
 * hinge.setEulerAngles(0, 0, 90);
 * hinge.addComponent('joint', {
 *     type: JOINTTYPE_HINGE,
 *     entityA: door,
 *     entityB: doorFrame,
 *     enableLimits: true,
 *     limits: new Vec2(0, 110)
 * });
 * app.root.addChild(hinge);
 * ```
