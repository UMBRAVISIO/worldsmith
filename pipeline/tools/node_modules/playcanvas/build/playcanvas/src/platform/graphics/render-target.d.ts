/**
 * A render target is a rectangular rendering surface that can be rendered into, instead of the
 * screen. It wraps one or more color buffer {@link Texture}s and an optional depth (and stencil)
 * buffer. Once a camera or a render pass has rendered into it, the color texture holds the result
 * and can be used anywhere a normal texture can - applied to a material to display it in the
 * scene, or fed into further processing. This underpins effects such as in-world screens, mirrors
 * and portals, reflections, picking and custom multi-pass pipelines.
 *
 * ## Usage
 * Create a texture to render into, wrap it in a render target and assign it to a camera. The
 * texture must use a renderable, uncompressed format:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * const texture = new Texture(device, {
 *     width: 512,
 *     height: 512,
 *     format: PIXELFORMAT_SRGBA8,
 *     mipmaps: false,
 *     minFilter: FILTER_LINEAR,
 *     magFilter: FILTER_LINEAR
 * });
 *
 * const renderTarget = new RenderTarget({
 *     colorBuffer: texture,
 *     depth: true,
 *     origin: RENDERTARGET_ORIGIN_TOP
 * });
 *
 * // the camera renders into the texture instead of the screen
 * cameraEntity.camera.renderTarget = renderTarget;
 *
 * // and the texture can be used as any other, for example by a material
 * material.emissiveMap = texture;
 * ```
 *
 * When the result is sampled as a regular texture like this, specify the `origin` option as
 * {@link RENDERTARGET_ORIGIN_TOP}, which stores the image in the same orientation on all graphics
 * APIs. Multiple color buffers can be attached using the `colorBuffers` option, to render into
 * all of them simultaneously from a single pass (MRT).
 *
 * A live example: {@link https://playcanvas.github.io/#/graphics/render-to-texture}
 *
 * ## Multisampling (MSAA)
 * Set the `samples` option to a value greater than 1 to render with hardware anti-aliasing. The
 * render target internally allocates a multisampled buffer to render into, and automatically
 * resolves it into the single-sampled `colorBuffer` at the end of a render pass - the color
 * texture is used the same way as in the single-sampled case.
 *
 * ```javascript
 * const renderTarget = new RenderTarget({ colorBuffer: texture, depth: true, samples: 4 });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Explicit multisampled color buffers and custom resolves (WebGPU)
 * A multisampled texture (a {@link Texture} created with `samples` greater than 1, WebGPU only)
 * can be used as the color buffer directly. The render target then renders into its samples, and
 * the sample count is inferred from the texture. Provide a `resolveBuffer` to get the standard
 * hardware resolve, or omit it to keep the individual samples: these are then read in a shader
 * using `textureLoad` on a `texture_multisampled_2d`, typically by a follow-up pass implementing
 * a custom resolve - an operation the hardware resolve cannot express, such as a tonemapped or
 * min/max resolve. This is also the only way to use multisampling with formats the hardware
 * cannot resolve, such as integer formats.
 *
 * ```javascript
 * // a multisampled texture, rendered into directly
 * const msColor = new Texture(device, {
 *     width: 512,
 *     height: 512,
 *     format: PIXELFORMAT_RGBA16F,
 *     samples: 4
 * });
 *
 * // renders into the samples of msColor, which are stored (no resolve buffer),
 * // to be read by a custom resolve pass using textureLoad
 * const renderTarget = new RenderTarget({ colorBuffer: msColor, depth: true });
 * ```
 *
 * A live example: {@link https://playcanvas.github.io/#/graphics-advanced/custom-msaa-resolve}

export class RenderTarget {
    /**
     * Creates a new RenderTarget instance. A color buffer or a depth buffer must be set.
     *
     * @param {object} [options] - Object for passing optional arguments.
     * @param {boolean} [options.autoResolve] - If samples > 1, enables or disables automatic MSAA
     * resolve after rendering to this RT (see {@link resolve}). Applies to the implicit
     * multisampled path only - resolves of explicit multisampled attachments (a multisampled
     * `colorBuffer` with a `resolveBuffer`, or a multisampled `depthBuffer` with a
     * `depthResolveBuffer`) are controlled by the per-pass resolve flags instead. Defaults to
     * true.
     * @param {string} [options.depthResolveMode] - How the samples of the multisampled depth
     * buffer are resolved into a single depth value, whenever the depth of this render target is
     * resolved by a shader-based resolve (WebGPU only) - the depth grab pass (`sceneDepthMap`), a
     * depth {@link copy}, or the automatic resolve into a provided `depthBuffer`. Can be:
     *
     * - {@link DEPTHRESOLVE_MIN}: the minimum sample value - with a standard depth buffer this
     * selects the nearest surface, a conservative and stable choice for depth-consuming effects.
     * - {@link DEPTHRESOLVE_MAX}: the maximum sample value - the farthest surface.
     * - {@link DEPTHRESOLVE_SAMPLE0}: the value of the sample at index 0.
     *
     * Defaults to {@link DEPTHRESOLVE_MIN}. Ignored on WebGL2, where the sample selection of the
     * depth resolve is defined by the implementation. Can also be changed at any time using the
     * {@link depthResolveMode} property.
     * @param {Texture} [options.colorBuffer] - The texture that this render target will treat as a
     * rendering surface. This can be a multisampled texture (a texture created with `samples` > 1,
     * WebGPU only), in which case the render target renders directly into its samples, the sample
     * count is inferred from the texture, and an optional `resolveBuffer` receives the hardware
     * resolve.
     * @param {Texture[]} [options.colorBuffers] - The textures that this render target will treat
     * as a rendering surfaces. If this option is set, the colorBuffer option is ignored. All
     * textures must have the same sample count.
     * @param {Texture|null} [options.resolveBuffer] - A single-sampled texture that the
     * multisampled color buffer is hardware-resolved into at the end of a render pass. Only valid
     * when `colorBuffer` is a multisampled texture, and must match its format and dimensions. When
     * not provided, the multisampled samples are stored instead, to be read in a shader using
     * `textureLoad` (a custom resolve). Note that integer formats and {@link PIXELFORMAT_R32F}
     * cannot be hardware-resolved.
     * @param {(Texture|null)[]} [options.resolveBuffers] - Per-attachment resolve textures
     * matching `colorBuffers` by index; use null for attachments that should not be
     * hardware-resolved. If this option is set, the resolveBuffer option must not be used.
     * @param {boolean} [options.depth] - If set to true, depth buffer will be created. Defaults to
     * true. Ignored if depthBuffer is defined.
     * @param {Texture} [options.depthBuffer] - The texture that this render target will treat as a
     * depth/stencil surface. If set, the 'depth' and 'stencil' properties are ignored. The texture
     * must use {@link PIXELFORMAT_DEPTH}, {@link PIXELFORMAT_DEPTH16} or
     * {@link PIXELFORMAT_DEPTHSTENCIL} format. On WebGPU this can be a multisampled texture (a
     * texture created with `samples` > 1), in which case the render target renders directly into
     * its depth samples, which can later be read in a shader using `textureLoad` on a
     * `texture_depth_multisampled_2d`, or resolved into an optional `depthResolveBuffer`.
     * @param {Texture} [options.depthResolveBuffer] - A single-sampled {@link PIXELFORMAT_R32F}
     * texture that the multisampled depth buffer is resolved into at the end of a render pass,
     * using a shader-based resolve controlled by {@link RenderTarget#depthResolveMode} (WebGPU
     * only - no hardware depth resolve exists). Only valid when `depthBuffer` is a multisampled
     * texture, and must match its dimensions.
     * @param {number} [options.mipLevel] - If set to a number greater than 0, the render target
     * will render to the specified mip level of the color buffer. Defaults to 0.
     * @param {number} [options.face] - If the colorBuffer parameter is a cubemap, use this option
     * to specify the face of the cubemap to render to. Can be:
     *
     * - {@link CUBEFACE_POSX}
     * - {@link CUBEFACE_NEGX}
     * - {@link CUBEFACE_POSY}
     * - {@link CUBEFACE_NEGY}
     * - {@link CUBEFACE_POSZ}
     * - {@link CUBEFACE_NEGZ}
     *
     * Defaults to {@link CUBEFACE_POSX}.
     * @param {string} [options.name] - The name of the render target.
     * @param {string} [options.origin] - Controls the vertical orientation of the image stored
     * in the render target. Choose based on how the texture is sampled. Can be:
     *
     * - {@link RENDERTARGET_ORIGIN_TOP}: row 0 of the stored image is the top row of the
     * rendered image, on all graphics APIs - the same layout image textures use. Use for
     * anything treated as a picture: sampling with mesh UVs, cube map faces, or pixel readback
     * saved as an image. Recommended for all new content - write the sampling code as if the
     * texture was a loaded image. Internally the image is rendered upside-down on WebGL2.
     * - {@link RENDERTARGET_ORIGIN_BOTTOM}: row 0 of the stored image is the bottom row of the
     * rendered image, on all graphics APIs - replicating WebGL2's native layout. Use to keep
     * consuming code written against WebGL conventions working unchanged on all APIs: shaders
     * deriving UVs from projected (NDC) coordinates or a projection scale-bias matrix, and
     * texture atlases addressing cells by viewport rectangles (on WebGPU this also switches
     * viewport / scissor rectangles to raw texel-row addressing). If a render target that worked
     * on WebGL2 appears upside-down on WebGPU, this is the drop-in fix; migrating the sampling
     * code to image orientation and {@link RENDERTARGET_ORIGIN_TOP} is the better long-term
     * choice. Internally the image is rendered upside-down on WebGPU.
     * - {@link RENDERTARGET_ORIGIN_NATIVE}: the image is stored in the native orientation of the
     * graphics API and the row order differs between WebGL2 (bottom-up) and WebGPU (top-down).
     * No flipping takes place. Only appropriate for orientation-agnostic consumers: UVs derived
     * from gl_FragCoord, sampling via the same matrix the target was rendered with (shadow
     * maps), or integer texel fetch.
     *
     * Takes precedence over the deprecated `flipY` option. Defaults to
     * {@link RENDERTARGET_ORIGIN_NATIVE}.
     * @param {number} [options.samples] - Number of hardware anti-aliasing samples. Default is 1.
     * @param {boolean} [options.stencil] - If set to true, depth buffer will include stencil.
     * Defaults to false. Ignored if depthBuffer is defined or depth is false.
     * @param {boolean} [options.transientColor] - If set to true, the multi-sampled (MSAA) color
     * attachment is allocated as a transient ("memoryless") attachment, allowing tile-based GPUs to
     * keep its contents in on-chip memory and avoid VRAM allocation. WebGPU only, and only effective
     * when samples > 1 - it has no effect on single-sampled color (which is always stored). Ignored
     * on devices without transient attachment support. The attachment must be cleared on load and
     * discarded on store, so it is incompatible with a scene color grab pass (`sceneColorMap`).
     * Defaults to false.
     * @param {boolean} [options.transientDepth] - If set to true, the (engine-allocated) depth
     * attachment is allocated as a transient ("memoryless") attachment (see `transientColor`).
     * Applies to both single- and multi-sampled depth. WebGPU only; ignored on devices without
     * transient attachment support, and ignored (with a warning) when an explicit `depthBuffer` is
     * provided. Incompatible with a scene depth grab pass (`sceneDepthMap`), a depth prepass, or any
     * depth resolve, as the depth cannot be sampled or copied out. Defaults to false.
     * @example
     * // Create a 512x512x24-bit render target with a depth buffer
     * const colorBuffer = new Texture(graphicsDevice, {
     *     width: 512,
     *     height: 512,
     *     format: PIXELFORMAT_RGB8
     * });
     * const renderTarget = new RenderTarget({
     *     colorBuffer: colorBuffer,
     *     depth: true
     * });
     *
     * // Set the render target on a camera component
     * camera.renderTarget = renderTarget;
     *
     * // Destroy render target at a later stage. Note that the color buffer needs
     * // to be destroyed separately.

     * renderTarget.destroy();
